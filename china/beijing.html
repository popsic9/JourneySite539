            <p class="words"><b>The Great Wall of Badaling</b> is a pass for the Ming Great Wall. It is beautiful yet steep. A saying goes, "you are not a hero until you reach the Great Wall". Most locals take this spot to be the start of the ascent of the Great Wall. The Great Wall of Badaling Guancheng has two doors in the east and west. The title of the East Gate is "Juyong Waizhen", and the West Gate title "Beimen Suoyue". The Great Wall north of Guancheng is the Northern Great Wall, with 12 enemy buildings. South of Guancheng is the Southern Great Wall, with 7 enemy buildings. The number of tourists on the Southern Great Wall is comparatively less than that on the Northern Great Wall. If time permits, you can head to the Southern Great Wall first before going to the Northern Great Wall.</p>

            <p class="words"><b>The Bird's Nest</b> is officially called National Stadium. It is located on the northern part of Beijing. In 2008 it hosted the Beijing Olympics. Due to its magnificent architecture and the international competitions that are regularly hosted there, it has become a famous landmark in recent years. The exterior of the Bird's Nest is made up of intersecting steel sections that look like branches forming a huge nest. The unique shape of the stadium is truly stunning. The Olympic cauldron, shaped like a torch and originally mounted on top of the Bird's Nest, has been moved to the Torch Square northeast of the stadium. It is still visible from the outside of the stadium. Nearly 100,000 spectator seats fill the interior of the Bird's Nest. Their bright red color is magnificent.</p>

            <p class="words"><b>Forbidden City.</b> A vast majority of tourists who visit Beijing for the first time consider the Forbidden City as a place they must see. The Forbidden City, known as Gugong in Mandarin, is the royal palace of the Ming and Qing dynasties. It is also the symbol of ancient China. Although it is no longer China's political center, you can still feel its former glory once you are within the courtyard and surrounded by the high walls. Its long history has left behind a large number of precious architecture and cultural relics, thus becoming the main point of attraction for the Forbidden City.</p>

            <p class="words"><b>Forbidden City.</b>  is a famous imperial garden built during the Qing Dynasty. It consists of three sections: Yuanming Garden, Changchun Garden, and Yichun Garden. It is incomparably beautiful and has the honor "the garden of gardens." In 1860, British and French troops burned the main buildings into ashes. Nowadays, tourists can only look at the wreckage and imagine its glory during the time of the Qing Dynasty. If your imagination is not enough, you can learn more about what the garden looked like through the detailed explanation at the "Old Summer Palace Heyday Panorama Model" in Changchun Garden.</p>
